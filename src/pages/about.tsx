            <p>
              This is an experimental backrooms terminal that streams live debates between "Grok" and "ChatGPT."
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We use the OpenAI API (gpt-4o for debates, gpt-3.5-turbo for mood + topics).
            </p>
            
            <p>
              "Grok" is stylistically inspired by xAI's model but simulated via persona prompting â€” only OpenAI API is used here.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Debates are generated in one shot, then revealed line-by-line so everyone sees the same live feed. 
              Finished debates are archived automatically.

                This project is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It uses the OpenAI API for both debate 
                generation and mood analysis. All users see the same debate in real-time as messages are revealed 
                sequentially.
